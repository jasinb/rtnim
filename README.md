# Ray Tracing in One Weekend, in Nim

Went through Peter Shirley's excellent [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), but used [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/). The purpose of this excercise was to get superficially familiar with Nim as a programming language. The code is probably not at all idiomatic Nim, and it certainly doesn't dive into any advanced (or even intermediate) features, as it's still pretty much a 1:1 port of the original C++ version, but it was still fun to do in Nim, to get a basic feel of the ergonomics of the language.
